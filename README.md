## Prerequisites

This extension requires GNOME Shell 45 or later. For earlier versions, please see the `pre-45` git branch.

Before installing, ensure you have the necessary system packages (note that if you're installing [via a package manager](#package-manager-installation), you may not need to manually install these packages):

- Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```
  sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gnome-system-monitor
  ```

- Fedora:
  ```
  sudo dnf install libgtop2-devel NetworkManager-libnm-devel gnome-system-monitor
  ```

- Arch Linux:
  ```
  sudo pacman -S libgtop networkmanager gnome-system-monitor clutter
  ```

- openSUSE (Leap 42.1):
  ```
  sudo zypper install gnome-shell-devel libgtop-devel libgtop-2_0-10 gnome-system-monitor
  ```

- Mageia 64-bit:
  ```
  sudo urpmi lib64gtop-gir2.0 lib64nm-gir1.0 lib64clutter-gir1.0 gnome-system-monitor
  ```
  or
  ```
  sudo dnf install lib64gtop-gir2.0 lib64nm-gir1.0 lib64clutter-gir1.0 gnome-system-monitor
  ```

- NixOS:
  Add to your `configuration.nix`:
  ```nix
  environment.variables = {
      GI_TYPELIB_PATH = "/run/current-system/sw/lib/girepository-1.0";
  };
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
      libgtop
  ];
  ```

For NVIDIA graphics card memory monitoring, install `nvidia-smi`.

## Installation

There are three ways to install this extension: via the browser, via a package manager, or manually.

### Browser Installation

1. If you haven't done so already, install the [gnome-browser-connector](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gnome-browser-integration/pages/installation-guide.html) package using your distro's package manager, as well as the GNOME Shell integration browser extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep). If you've already installed other GNOME Shell extensions from extensions.gnome.org, you can skip this step.
2. Visit [the system-monitor-next page on extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3010/system-monitor-next/).
3. Click the toggle button next to the extension's name to install.

If the installation was successful, the toggle button should now show "ON". If it failed (or if you see an error message like "Meta is null" in the GNOME Extensions app), please ensure that you have installed all of the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), that you have restarted GNOME Shell, and that your GNOME Shell version is supported.

### Package Manager Installation

This extension is available in the repositories of several distributions for any users who prefer to leave extension updates to their package manager:

- **Fedora**: `dnf install gnome-shell-extension-system-monitor-applet`

After installation, the extension will be available for enabling in GNOME Extensions app.

*(Note for maintainers: if your distro is not listed here please feel free to open an issue or drop a PR!)*

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mgalgs/gnome-shell-system-monitor-next-applet.git
   ```
2. Create a symlink:
   ```
   cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
   ln -sv /path/to/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/system-monitor-next@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com/
   ```
3. Reload GNOME Shell:
   - X11: Press `Alt+F2`, type `r`, and press Enter
   - Wayland: Log out and log back in
4. Enable the extension:
   ```
   gnome-extensions enable system-monitor-next@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com
   ```

Now you can hack away on the extension in your clone of the repo and test
your changes by reloading GNOME Shell.

## Usage

After installation, the system monitor will appear in your top panel. You can configure its appearance and behavior through the GNOME Extensions app or by clicking on the panel and selecting "Preferences".

## Development

### Manual Installation for Development

To work on the extension, you'll need to clone and symlink the repository as described in the [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) section above.

### Developing under X11

For X11 sessions, you can easily reload GNOME Shell after making changes:

1. Press `Alt+F2`
2. Type `r` and press Enter

This will restart GNOME Shell, allowing you to see your changes immediately.

### Developing under Wayland

Wayland currently doesn't have a way to reload GNOME Shell, so you'll need to log out and log back in. This is a bit of a pain, so you can use Wayland's "nested sessions" feature to avoid constant logging out and in:

1. Start a nested session:
   ```
   dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --nested --wayland
   ```
2. Start a new terminal *inside* the nested session. Don't panic if the terminal appears outside the nested window - the dbus session address will be configured to point at the nested session.
3. In this new terminal, enable the extension:
   ```
   gnome-extensions enable system-monitor-next@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com
   ```

You might also need to enable the extension using the GNOME Extensions app inside your nested session.

To capture debug logs and set a custom screen size for the nested session:

```
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all MUTTER_DEBUG_DUMMY_MODE_SPECS=1366x768 dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --nested --wayland |& tee /tmp/logs.txt
```

## Translation

To contribute a translation:
1. Fork the repository
2. Add/update your `po/<YOUR_LANG>/system-monitor-applet.po` file
3. Submit a pull request
4. Drink water

## Deployment

To create a ZIP file for upload to GNOME Shell Extensions:

```
make zip-file VERSION=<version>
```

This process used to be automated by [the uploader Github Action](actions/uploader)
but has since been disabled since it required user credentials to be saved in the
repo secrets. The `gnome-extensions` tool [has recently gained an `upload`
subcommand](https://gjs.guide/extensions/upgrading/gnome-shell-49.html#extension-tools)
(which could be used in place of the upload.py Python script), but it still requires
username and password to be present in the repo secrets, so is likely still not a
good option for a CI-based solution (more research on this is required).

## Fork Information

This repository was originally forked from `paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet` for packaging purposes, aiming to maintain a continuously updated release on [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3010/system-monitor-next/). As the upstream repository appears to be unmaintained, this is now a full and proper fork.
